## What is Cloud Hosting & How Does it Work

Cloud Hosting has the status of being the latest form of web hosting. 

In fact, Cloud Hosting has become extremely popular over recent years. 

The corporate giants mainly prefer cloud Hosting. 


### What is Cloud Hosting? 

Cloud Hosting operates by using the latest Cloud Computing technologies that involve using an unlimited number of machines acting as one system. 

So, Cloud Hosting differs from traditional forms of web hosting because it is guaranteed by many servers instead of depending on just a single server only. 

Further up, the cloud technology ensures the easy integration of extra resources (including RAM), thus enabling website growth. 

So, when you go for Cloud Hosting, your website operates across various interconnected servers, which means that data is rendered from multiple servers. 

In Cloud Hosting, downtime chances are significantly reduced as resources for hosting your website are spread across many web servers. 

Moreover, when your website faces peak loads, cloud hosting ensures that there are no bandwidth issues. Many servers can provide additional resources when such a need arises. 

Thus, Cloud Hosting operates on the concept of "Divide and Rule." 

### Example of Cloud Hosting

The best example of Cloud Hosting is Google itself. 

Google has its resources spread over numerous (hundreds in number) servers on the cloud. 

That's precisely the reason why you never experience downtime issues with Google.com. It has maintained nearly 100% uptime over the past decade or so. 


### How does it work? 

In Cloud Hosting, each server is assigned a particular set of tasks. In case any of the servers face some issues (for instance, say failure), another server is available as a backup that temporarily offers the required resources until the time the problems are resolved. 

The same scenario happens when an overload condition arises. 

There's another server to take over and handle the tasks temporarily whenever there is any problem. 

Moreover, in Cloud Hosting, there is the paramount importance of the quality of server hardware used. So, to deliver top-notch performance, the hosting provider has to use high-quality server hardware invariably.

However, this is now changing as several mid-size organizations are making a move to the cloud arena. 

Even Small businesses that are eyeing steep growth are making a move to Cloud Hosting. 

This favorable change for cloud hosting has been triggered by a marked decrease in its pricing over the last 4-5 years. 

Now, organizations are aware of cloud hosting's advantages and do not hesitate to pay some extra dollars. 

They consider Cloud Hosting- A Worthy Investment. 

Much is anticipated that the "costs" involved in Cloud Hosting would further come down shortly, thus making it a hit with even small businesses. 

Several large enterprises have already shifted to Cloud Hosting. 

The days are not far when everybody would be in the clouds!!
